#ASU Open Seat Detection
<p>This program was designed to notify me when classes open up at Arizona State University that are typically full, but I need/want to take for the semester. The app has the ability to send notifications via the console, SMS and Email automatically. This application is CRON compatible.</p>

#Useage
<p>DL the script and associated dependencies. You will need a trial account of Twilio SMS to validate the AUTH key for their API. Other than that, just fill out the SMPT email credentials and you're good to do.
